# COMP3421 Group 3 Project - Chat Together

## Abstract 

In this project, we are going to develop a chat application using technologies like PHP and MySQL for backend logic implementation and database management. HTML and CSS are used to develop the frontend. 

In this chat app, new users will first sign up for an account using an email account and password, after they have signed up successfully, they enter a dashboard with names of other registered users. The users have their full name, profile image, active status. They can click on any users to start a chat. 

Users can logout of the chat app by clicking the logout button. After logging out, users will be redirected to the login page. The status of the user will turn offline. Users need to fill in their credentials again to reenter the chat app.
